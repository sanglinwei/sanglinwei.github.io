## About Me
I recieved the B.S and M.S degree from Southeast University, Nangjing, China with honors in 2018, 2021 respectively. I’m current pursing my Ph.d degree advised by Prof. Yinliang Xu in Tsinghua University, which belongs to EMS group head by Prof. Hongbin Sun. I am visiting UC, Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Shmuel S. Oren](https://oren.ieor.berkeley.edu/)

### Research Statements
I am working on leveraging the machine learning and optimization techniques to solve the power system problems.
### Research Interests
Semo-end-to-end model, Learn-to-optimize, and Constraint learning.

## Recent News
