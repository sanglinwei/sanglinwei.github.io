## About Me
I recieved the B.S and M.S degree from Southeast University, Nangjing, China with honors in 2018, 2021 respectively. I’m current pursing my Ph.d degree advised by Prof. Yinliang Xu in Tsinghua University, which belongs to EMS group head by Prof. Hongbin Sun. I am visiting UC, Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Shmuel S. Oren](https://oren.ieor.berkeley.edu/)

### Research Statements
I am working on leveraging the machine learning and optimization techniques to solve the power system problems.
### Research Interests
Semo-end-to-end model, Learn-to-optimize, and Constraint learning.

## Recent News
- I start my journey in University of California, Berkeley advised by Prof. Oren in May 4th, 2023.
- Our paper “Encoding Carbon Emission Flow in Energy Management: A Compact Constraint Learning Approach,” was accepted to  IEEE Transactions on Sustain. Energy, May, 2023.
- Our paper “Conservative Sparse Neural Network Embedded Frequency-Constrained Unit Commitment With Distributed Energy Resources” was accepted to IEEE Trans. on Sustain. Energy, Apr. 2023.
